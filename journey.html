					<p>I received my bachelor's degree in Production Engineering in 2012.</p>
					<p>By that time, I had already accumulated 4 years of full-time effective work experience in the area, unlike many of my peers.</p>

					<p>With my diploma in hands, I felt the need to venture into different seas. I applied to one of the most challanging recruitment processes in Brazil to become a Business Consultant.
					</p>
					<p>After two months confined in a hotel with my competitors, it was announced that I was in the group of people selected to take the positions availalbe.</p>
					<p>My mission was to enable innovation in small and medium-sized companies. I made use of strategies that included introduction of new technologies, rethinking business models and changing marketing strategies.</p>

					<p>My next adventrue took place in the second largest Brazilian broadcasting company, RBS.</p>
					<p>My commitment to meeting the company's targets rendered me a 100% sponsorship to undertake a 2-year postgraduation course.</p>
					<p>However, the wind changed its direction, and I abandoned the course in response to the most awaited call to move to Australia.</p>

					<p>EGR had me in the midst of their business reestructure.</p>
					<p>As a Business Process Analyst, I was involved in several ICT projects that enabled company's digital transformation. There couldn't have been a more challenging place to become an expert in eliciting requirements and designing solutions. </p>
					<p>However, the development team wasn't keeping up with the volume of projects and I really wanted to help...</p>

				<div class="text-slide">
					<p>I decided I wanted to study programing to eventually help develop my own BA projects.</p>
					<p>In the end of 2021 I had to leave EGR due to family obligations and I took the opportunity to undertake a postgraduation study in IT. </p>
					<p>I am currently amazed with the amount of knowledge this opportunity is offering me. It is striking to see the advantages of being both an analyst and a programmer. </p>
